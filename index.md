## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">

Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor at the School of Government at the Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, México. I am also the director of the interdisciplinary Laboratory of Computational Social Science - México ([iLCSS](https://ilcss.umd.edu/). Previously, I was a Post-Doctoral Fellow at Department of Political Science at the University of Houston. I earned my Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Maryland, College Park.

## Research Interest

My research explores the relation between gendered political institutions and representation, and racial identity and racism in Latin America. I am particularly interested in the gendered barriers in political institutions, and the strategic reaction of political actors when encountering these barriers. My methodological work applies novel Natural Language Processing (NLP) to a wide variety of text data, from legislative speeches to tweets, to answer substantive questions about gender, racism, and politics.

You can find my CV here.
